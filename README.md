US-Romanian Keyboard Layout
============
This is a custom keyboard layout for Windows which allows letters from the Romanian alphabet to be typed on a typical US keyboard.  To type the desired letter, press the dead key followed by the base key.  For example, ț = press the "," key, then "t".  Press the keys one after the other, not at the same time.

To type the character reserved for the dead key, press the dead key followed by the spacebar.  For example, , = press the "," key, then spacebar.

Building the Keyboard
=====================
Use Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC), to build the keyboard into an installable package.  It can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).
